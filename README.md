# OnePlace-Android-Application

- Been developing a handful of Machine Learning models but wanted to do something different which makes the models useful. 
- Since I had prior experience in building Android apps and flask, wrote the ML models as API and deployed it in GCP. 
- Used Retrofit to handle the REST based web API to upload inputs as JSON and retrieve inputs as JSON.

Unfortunately missed the source files, very lazy to decompile the app.
